This is a basic Navigation component for re-use, made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

## How to use

First, you must install Next.js:

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Followed by Framer Motion:

```
npm install framer-motion
```

Then you are able to copy and paste the code from Navbar.js into your own project. If you are using this for your own projects, you must credit this repository.
